- Include pass/fail information in probabilistic algorithm
- Somehow makes user able to say "include i" or "include k" on-the-fly -> mark as desired/undesired
- Let user able to say "a must equal b" or "a must not equal b" and use that to filter patches


- Branch coverage
- Find the great use case!
- User scenario: 
    Alex looks at old teammate code.
    VS team generates many patches.
    She crosses out some.
    6 left.
    Look at runtime value.
    Look at branch coverage.
